## API Authentication

This project uses **Laravel Sanctum** to secure API endpoints and provide token-based authentication for users.

- Sanctum issues API tokens that can be used to authenticate requests from frontend or third-party clients.
- Users can log in and receive a personal access token, which must be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for protected API routes.
- This ensures that only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations via API.
- Sanctum also supports SPA authentication out of the box using Laravelâ€™s built-in session cookies.

### How it works in this project

- Login endpoints issue Sanctum tokens upon successful authentication.
- API routes in `routes/api.php` are protected with the `auth:sanctum` middleware.
- Frontend requests made with jQuery or any HTTP client must include the token for authentication.
- Token management (issuing, revoking) is handled through Laravel controllers.
